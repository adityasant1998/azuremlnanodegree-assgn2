# Project Overview:

This project explores building and deploying a machine learning model for a bank marketing scenario. We'll leverage Azure's cloud capabilities to achieve the following:

Model Training:
Utilize Azure AutoML for automated model building with a classification task.
Deploy the highest-performing model (a voting ensemble in this case).
Model Deployment:
Host the model on Azure Container Instances (ACI) with secure authentication.
Expose the model through REST endpoints for easy access.
Pipeline Creation:
Design and publish a machine learning pipeline using Azure ML Studio or Python SDK.
Enable consumption of the pipeline through REST endpoints.

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step.

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screencasts required to demonstrate key steps. 

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
